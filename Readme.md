# 🧠 Mental Health & Depression Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze mental health and depression-related data using machine learning and statistical techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential predictive features that can contribute to better understanding and early identification of mental health issues.

## 📂 Datasets Used

This project involves two primary datasets:

1. **Kaggle Dataset**
   This dataset comprises mental health data from 1977 Bangladeshi university students across 15 top universities, collected from November to December 2023 using Google Forms. It includes assessments of academic anxiety, stress, and depression using widely used psychometric scales. The structured questionnaire covers sociodemographic variables and their associations, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

2. **DAIC-WOZ** (Undecided)
   This database contains clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   
   These interviews were collected as part of a larger effort to create a computer agent that interviews people and identifies verbal and nonverbal indicators of mental illness (DeVault et al., 2014).  
   
   Data collected include audio and video recordings and extensive questionnaire responses; this part of the corpus includes data from the Wizard-of-Oz interviews, conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie, controlled by a human interviewer in another room.

   > **Note**: At the time of writing, access to this dataset is pending. Further work will be extended once permission is granted.

## 🚧 Current Status

* ✅ Initial data exploration and cleaning on the Kaggle dataset
* ⏳ Awaiting approval for access to the restricted dataset
* 📊 Planning comparative analysis once both datasets are available

## 📌 Notes

* This project is strictly for educational and research purposes.
* If you intend to use the restricted dataset, please apply through the official portal and adhere to their terms of use.
