# 🧠 Mental Health & Depression Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze mental health and depression-related data using machine learning and statistical techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential predictive features that can contribute to better understanding and early identification of mental health issues.

   > **Note**: At the time of writing, access to this dataset is pending. Further work will be extended once permission is granted.

## 🚧 Current Status

* ✅ Initial data exploration and cleaning on the Kaggle dataset
* ⏳ Awaiting approval for access to the restricted dataset
* 📊 Planning comparative analysis once both datasets are available
